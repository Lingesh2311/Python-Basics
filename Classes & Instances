This is a basic tutorial on Classes and Instances in Python


Class Attributes and Class Instances

Class Attributes:
    - They belong to the class itself, they are shared
    by all the instances. Such attributes are defined in#
    the class body parts at the top of the class.
Instance Attributes:
    - They are not shared by the objects. Every object has
    its own copy of the instance attribute. To list all the
    attributes of an instance/ object, we have two functions
        - vars(): Displays the attribute of an instance in the
        form of a dictionary
        - dir(): This function displays more attributes than vars
        function, and it is not limited to an instance. It displays
        the class attributes and methods as well.
