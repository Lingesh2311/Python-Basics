### Generators in Python
<p>
They are used for <i>lazy evaluation</i> in Python. The generator functions are used to create the iterator that gives out the iterator object which can create the <code>next()</code> method to get the necessary result.

This folder contains scripts explaining the concept of Generators in Python. 

Generators are iterators, a kind of iterable you can only iterate over once. Generators do not store all the values in memory, they generate the values on the fly.

The `yield` keyword is just like a return statement but will give us back a **generator** not an memory intensive iterable.
