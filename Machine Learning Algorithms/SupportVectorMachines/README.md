## Support Vector Machines

<p>
    They are used for both classification and regression. The Naive Bayes Classifier was the generative classifier whereas SVM's can be considered to be a discriminative classifier.

    <p>
        Rather than modelling each class, here we try to find a best fit line, or curve, or manifold that can best discriminate the classes under consideration. We will choose the line of best fit that maximizes the margin. Hence, the SVM's are also know as the Maximum Margin Estimator.

### Kernel Trick
This is a mathematical perk for converting a non-seperable data points to a set of separable points. It converts a low dimension cluster to a set of higher dimension equivalent. This will make the problem a linear one.
